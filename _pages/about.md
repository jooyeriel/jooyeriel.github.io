I am a Ph.D. student at the Center for Digital Innovation & Dept. of Computer Information Systems, Georgia State University. I am working under supervision of Professor Arun Rai. My research primarily centers around artificial intelligence, labor markets, and future of work.

Before joining the Ph.D. program, I received a Masterâ€™s degree in Management Engineering at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST).
