I am a Ph.D. student in Department of Computer Information Systems, Georgia State University. I am working under supervision of [Professor Likoebe Maruping](https://lmaruping.com/). My research primarily centers around platform ecosystems, user behaviors, design component of platforms and green IS.

Before joining the Ph.D. program, I received a Masterâ€™s degree in Management Information Systems at the Korea University.
